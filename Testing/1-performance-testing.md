## Peformance testing 
It is a type of testing that ensures that some functionality under the certain workload

But functional testing doesn't have this condition of workload. 

Functional tests that we write in the application only test the functionality without any pre-condition of workload. It is the perfomance testing that tests the non-function requirements. And see if these are being met or not.


Before trying to fix performance issues, be sure to perform an audit of system using performance testing & then try to fix the errors.
